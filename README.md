# Internship

This program was made in on a 10 week intership in Booff swedish football club.
It is not fully functional and will require fixes to set up on the internet.

The reason for the names on the two first folders "data_managment" and "case_1" is because when the intership started we were given three cases, basically three tasks, but the first case where we were to build a website kept growing in scope so we did not manage to start on the other cases, hence the name. The "data_managment" came from being asked to help in some data that JÃ¶rgen requested help with in the middle of the project which led to that one bing created and added to the tasks.

# instructions to launch the project
To launch the project you need to download to your computer
node 18.17.1
postgresql 15

Go into /case_1 and launch a npm install to download all neccesary libraries.

Add a .env file in /case_1/backend where you will need to add two varibles, REACT_APP_USER_PASSWORD and ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET. REACT_APP_USER_PASSWORD is to be equal to the postgresql password. The ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET is the varible the jwt token will use for encryption, it should have a long value of random characters.

In the file /case_1/backend/database/db.sql are the database types and tables you will need to copy into your postgresql sql shell. You can of course create them in pgAdmin, but it was created so you can copy and paste the entire file inte sql shell and work.

In the file /case_1/backend/database/dbFunctions.sql are the functions the project will use in the sql prompts, it was created so you can copy the entire file into sql shell for quick installation.

Once all previous steps are completed you launch the project by running "npm start" in the /case_1 directory, and launching the index.js file in the backend, we launched by writing "nodemn index.js" this should launch the project. If it did not work maybe check if you need to update either node or postgres.

# The structure 

### Frontend

/case_1 is the project directory for the website and here is where npm start is launched

It follows the structure of a newly created react project, with index.js rendering app.js which renders all other pages depending on which page should be open. 

in the src folder there are three folders "pages", "components" and "assets". The "pages" folder contains all pages that are present in the website. It contains four folders, "adminAccess" which contain pages admins should only be able to se. "coachAccess" Which contain pages that coaches access. "refereeAccess", folder for referees, and the "publicAccess" which contian pages you can access without logging in. The othe files outside these folders are pages that two or more of the diffrent roles can access.

The components folder contain components that the pages from "pages" folder import, the components are in folders that have names somewhat simular to the file that is calling it. The "matchSearch" file is for the overview file, but i did not have time to finish it.

In the "admin" folder there are two files for importing excel files, one for matches, one for accounts. You need to name the name for the table to be inported.

### Backend

/case_1/backend the directory for backend here you will find a file called index.js, launch it with node indes.js or nodemon indes.js to start the backend.

In /case_1/backend has two folders one called database and another called components. The database folder contains the db.js file, which contains the information to connect to postgresqt. The other three files in the database folder are for sql code to be copied over to postgresql to ensure that the sql functions and tables are the same on all instences of this project. The reason for so many functions to there are for sql, is that it helps prevent sql injection, this is the biggest reason for the many functions inside sql.

Between the two folders in the backend folder the components folder is the one containing functions called upon in the index.js file in the backend folder. This was done to shorten and split up the index.js file so it would be more readable.

# Issues

When importing accounts password for all accounts created are "placeholder", the idea was for random passwords to be created and sent to the assigned email. But the email function was never implemented.
Email has not been implemented.
Css could be improved.
Having to go back fixing code for being given new requirments have led to several mistakes troughout the code, that we did not have the time too fix or locate. So there are issues that have been missed.
